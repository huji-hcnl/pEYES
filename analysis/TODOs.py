# TODO: This file is a placeholder for the TODOs that need to be addressed in the analysis/added to peyes

######################
# Documentation:
# add example usage in the `docs` directory
# add documentation for keyword arguments + licensing of each dataset + detector

######################
# New Detectors:
# I-DVT - detect fixations by small dispersion, and saccade/SP by velocity
# ML Detectors: hold an instance of model that can be loaded from file or trained
#    I-RF - Random Forest detector (with/without XGBoost)
#    I-1D-CNN - 1D Convolutional Neural Network detector

######################
# Dataset Loaders:
# Add support for EEGEyeNet dataset (require premature downloading and enable only loading from disk)?

######################
# Analysis:
# Permutation Tests between "similar" detectors?
# Bayesian analysis?
