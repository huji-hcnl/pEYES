    "## Event Matching\n",
    "Event matching is the process of mapping between two sequences of events(ground-truth & prediction), based on some matching criteria (_\"matching scheme\"_). A matching could be between events from the same type or from different types; it could allow multiple predicted-events to match a single ground-truth-event or vice versa, and so on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In their article _\"Evaluating eye movement event detection: A review of the state of the art\"_ (2023), Stratsev & Zemblys include a dedicated chapter on Event-Matching. They describe various methods to match semi-overlapping sequences of events, originating from two different detection sources (e.g. a human annotator & a detection algorithm). They discuss different considerations that should be taken into account, and demonstrate how different matching schemes may affect the outcome. We encourage anyone working with this type of analysis to read their report before applying this logic onto their data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `pEYES` package provides implementations for various matching schemes described in the aforementioned article, including _IoU_, _Window-Based_, etc. Two sequences of `Event` objects can be matched, using the `peyes.match()` function, which requires also specifying a matching-scheme (`match_by` argument) and whether you allow for _cross-matching_ - can events of different types be matched or not. The function's documentation provides useful information on the available matching-schemes and the parameters required to run them.  \n",
    "**Note** that event matching is a time-consuming process that may require long runtime and exhaustive compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will match only one predicted sequence against a corresponding ground-truth. We will use the strictest matching-scheme available in `pEYES`, _l2_, which only matches events if the $l_2$ norm of the differences between their onset- and offset-times is lesser than some threshold (set here to 15ms). For more information, see the Stratsev & Zemblys article."
